Currently a full-stack web development student at Humber College, I have experience creating dynamic web pages using technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, C#, MERN stack, and SQL. I am looking forward to connecting with passionate individuals and expanding my knowledge/experience in this exciting field.
