![Fazhrul Sadip](../images/sadipnsu.jpg)

I have expertise developing dynamic web pages utilizing technologies including Javascript, HTML, CSS, Angular, Bootstrap, C#, MERN stack, and SQL. I'm now a full-stack web development student at Humber College. For 1 year, I worked as software developer in the IT industry back in my home country. The opportunity to establish connections with compatible people and increase my expertise in this fascinating profession is something I am looking forward to.
